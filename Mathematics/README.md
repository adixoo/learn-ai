# Mathematics 

Mathematics is an essential part of creating AI. AI performs tasks by predicting outcomes using probability. Additionally, AI requires data and experience; for managing data, we use statistics. Other parts of mathematics, such as linear algebra and calculus, are also used to solve complex equations.

Here are the important brach of mathematics that are used in ai


1. **Probability and Statistics**
   - **Why**: AI systems often predict outcomes and make decisions under uncertainty. Probability helps in modeling uncertainty, and statistics is crucial for data analysis, inference, and designing models.
